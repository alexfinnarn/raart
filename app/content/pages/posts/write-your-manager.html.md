- Trying to start a consulting business is hard
- There are large corporations already doing this
- I don't give a shit what people think, which is attractive to common people
- Fascists care what people think, and they control the large companies
- Just like in political discourse where the small, common man can write their representative
- We can tell developers to write their manager to get better career development
- Don't try to sell HR
- Sell the people HR is serving
- Everyone else is selling to HR
- Which makes the "no sell" unique and respectable

Act now! For the simple price of calling your manager you could be the lucky winner of a new career! 

Going fast! If you don't act now, you'll be stuck in your current role until you leave!

These are some of most click-baity titles I could think of for trying to get developers attention in a infomercial 
style format. I'd like to reach out and help developers better succeed at their jobs, but I thought I would need to 
start with HR (Human Resources), and work my way towards the developers. 

But will that work? If I can't make positive changes in any company I've worked in so far, I doubt any HR people 
will want to talk to me. After all, aren't I pointing my fingers at them for not doing what I think is best?

## Think Like a Politician

Enter politics. Politics are literally fights between life and death. Each side tries to convince you that choosing 
them will avert death and choosing their opponents will surely cause death. Politicians usually act on negative 
emotions since those are more effective at getting people to do anything. However, there come times where each 
political party's leadership doe not reflect the will of the people. 

Just the same, when companies are smaller and HR is less of its own thing, workers can perform HR duties themselves 
and therefore create the changes they want to see. Once a company grows, just like in politics, you get power 
hierarchies, politics, and people trying to hold their position more than anything else.

So, what do they do in politics? They start very small and local trying to flip some local political seats away from 
the closest dominant party. Then, after picking up steam with a few wins, they start going to larger municipalities, 
then to state-wide races, and then to the federal level. 

The one thing new opposition political people don't do is ask the mainstream political parties if they can take the 
helm. If that were possible, then the political party would naturally change itself as times change. But instead, 
they have to enact a sort of mutiny towards the parties in power by reaching out to the voter themselves.

Just like politics, sometimes the only way to change companies is to convince employees of radical ideas that they 
infect their companies with. I don't mean infect in a negative light, but it was the best word I could think of to 
represent the activity you must perform.

## Organizational Change Tactics

The traditional way to enact organizational change comes from the top. The C-level executives have a meeting, look 
where they can trim the fat, and swap/layoff people until financial targets are met. While this method is the most 
common, it doesn't help out anyone who is trying to change their company from the inside or someone trying to start 
a consulting business out of thin air. 

The traditional way of organizational change can be compare with the normal way war is conducted. A country declares 
war, appoints the high-level generals, and the generals command on down through the ranks. If the soldiers at the 
bottom level don't follow orders, then the whole army fails. The only way this method works is if the chain of 
command stays intact. 

Honestly, I would be fine if my company operated this way and provided clear directions and delegation on down the 
chain, but instead, many commands seem optional or are never even disseminated amongst the staff. If you know who to 
talk to you might get somewhere, but otherwise, all you can do is shout upwards.

The second way to effect change in a company mimics guerrilla warfare. Instead of waiting for your orders from the 
top and hoping they make sense, why not take matters into your own hands? Within a company this can be tricky, but 
if you are at a conference giving a talk, it turns into a good time. 

It is quite possible to instill ideas within developers that help to affect organizational change within the 
timespan of a conference. Ideally, you would be a speaker, but sometimes conferences let you hold impromptu "birds 
of a feather" ad hoc meetings that are perfect for getting thoughts on guerrilla campaigns against HR. 

## Building Networks

Before any guerrilla campaign can happen, there has to be guerrillas ready to fight the good fight. You should have 
a good group of compatriots within your company or maybe you can find some while attending conferences or local 
meetups. Anyone who likes improvement should be angry at their company in some fashion, and they usually look 
outside their company if they are frustrated.

You can probably spot them as newcomers to meetups, but it can be hard to gauge someone's skill level and what they 
are looking for. A lot of people looking for work at meetups are junior devs, and they simply haven't had enough 
time to be properly frustrated at the level you need them to be. Getting down because you can't fix a bug is vastly 
different than being pissed off because you don't feel like you are progressing in your career.

## The Incident

Most wars start with a bang. Something happens that causes society to lose it and start shooting anything that moves.
Usually this comes around an election, an assassination, famine, terrorist attack, or something like that. 




## Write Your Manager

- Need to create an intro that is non-threatening to managers

## Failure Pivoting

- Or is this a plea to create a personalized service?
- I could help people like myself reign in their career
- Give them advice to be the grass roots advocate in their company
- This would allow me to take on work as a per client basis
