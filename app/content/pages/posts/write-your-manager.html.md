- Trying to start a consulting business is hard
- There are large corporations already doing this
- I don't give a shit what people think, which is attractive to common people
- Fascists care what people think, and they control the large companies
- Just like in political discourse where the small, common man can write their representative
- We can tell developers to write their manager to get better career development
- Don't try to sell HR
- Sell the people HR is serving
- Everyone else is selling to HR
- Which makes the "no sell" unique and respectable 

- Need to create an intro that is non-threatening to managers

- Or is this a plea to create a personalized service?
- I could help people like myself reign in their career
- Give them advice to be the grass roots advocate in their company
- This would allow me to take on work as a per client basis
