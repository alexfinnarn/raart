- When writing code for an open source project, it starts out pragmatic if it is done by agencies trying to make money.
- However, if the devs are in a large internal group not working on client projects, they argue about the wrong things
- case in point with Drupal
- it started very practical and high speed of development
- then over time, Acquia OCTO started developing isolated from the real-world
- they painted themselves into a corner of abstractions with things like JSON:API
- point to issue where something is "impossible" that should be standard: you should be able to apply field 
  enhancers to all field instances of field types

- Difference between Laravel and Drupal
- Laravel people still work on products - products generated from tradeoffs
- Drupal people work on ideas - ideas that are final solutions
- ---
- conclusion: look for OSS where devs still make money for practical code, look for large companies that fund dev 
  work for impractical code

One of the hardest things to do when creating an open source project is to externalize your ideas in a format that 
others can help further your goals without much training. And if you don't write down your goals in an 
easy-to-digest format, those who like using your application will.

It always amuses me when people give someone completely new to a project the task of documenting something. Now how 
can someone new do that better when they don't have any history of the project or know where it's going. Even if the 
OG maintainers did a great job of writing down the mental framework they use when writing code, the newbie can't 
internalize that mentality without some hands on experience. 

Thus, never give documentation the "first issue" tag on GitHub. You'll never get your ideas laid out in the way you 
want if newcomers are driving the introduction notes.

But where do you start with your documentation? Well this brings up an interesting dichotomy as to how open source 
projects are born. Some come from project work where a framework gets extracted from a client project or set of 
projects. Others are generated after securing a funding source. 

These two approaches are so fundamentally different, they lead to different feelings and flavors the open source 
communities take on and keep interested parties coming back for more. Many tech meetups are focused on a particular 
framework or language for a reason even though the eventual product, the code, looks and functions just the same as 
another language or framework. 

In a lot of ways, people treat code like culture. You could live any where in the world and survive, but people 
fight literal wars over who lives the best lives. Why we can't cooperate better without destroying our global 
society is a tale for another time, but in this post I hope I can give you tools to naivgate OSS projects and help 
you find the ones that you'll stick around years later.
