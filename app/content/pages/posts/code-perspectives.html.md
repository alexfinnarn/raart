- When writing code for an open source project, it starts out pragmatic if it is done by agencies trying to make money.
- However, if the devs are in a large internal group not working on client projects, they argue about the wrong things
- case in point with Drupal
- it started very practical and high speed of development
- then over time, Acquia OCTO started developing isolated from the real-world
- they painted themselves into a corner of abstractions with things like JSON:API
- point to issue where something is "impossible" that should be standard: you should be able to apply field 
  enhancers to all field instances of field types

- Difference between Laravel and Drupal
- Laravel people still work on products - products generated from tradeoffs
- Drupal people work on ideas - ideas that are final solutions
- ---
- conclusion: look for OSS where devs still make money for practical code, look for large companies that fund dev 
  work for impractical code
